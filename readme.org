#+Title: script to maintain compressed copy of library

Basic script to maintain a compressed copy of the music library.  We:

- get list of all files in src
- get list of all files in dst
- re-encode any files in dst whose src mtime is newer than dst 
- remove any files in dst not in src (unless --no-delete
  specified)
- encode any files in src not in dst

We assume a working find.  It’s definitely faster than glob (though
I’ve not checked!)
