#+Title: script to maintain compressed copy of library

Basic script to maintain a compressed copy of the music library.  We:

- get list of all files in src
- get list of all files in dst
- build MAPPING src.LOSSLESS -> dst.LOSSLESS.opus
- remove any files in dst not in mapping (unless --no-delete
  specified)
- re-encode any files in MAPPING whose src mtime is newer than dst 
- encode any files in src not in dst
